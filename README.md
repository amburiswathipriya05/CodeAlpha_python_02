# âœ… TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker

## Goal:
Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock prices.

## Simplified Scope:
- User inputs stock names and quantity.
- Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}).
- Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a .txt or .csv file.

## Key Concepts Used:
`dictionary`, `input/output`, `basic arithmetic`, `file handling (optional)`

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using: `python stock_tracker.py`
